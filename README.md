# COVID_Project

### INTRODUCTION
This is the COVID analysis and visualization showing the total cases, deaths and vaccinations of the World population from Jan 2020 - March 2021.

#### TOOL USED
I used Microsoft SQL Server to import, clean and analyze my data. I got the data from [OurWorldinData](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

I used Tableau for my visualization, because Tableau does not connect to SQL Database, I copied my code results to Excel and saved them as .xlsx
files, then moved the data to Tableau. 

I created 8 sheets and 3 dashboards, I visualized a story of the infection rates, death count and the how the vaccination progression by country.
